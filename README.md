# Verify Your Votes & Publish All Votes at the End
 **During** the electioin some people says that their votes were hacked and <br />
 **The** political parties also claimed that they would get more votes if the voting was done in different way.
 * _Our idea is that when a voter cast his vote he will get an auto generated unique id at that time and_
  * _At the end of the election all the votes of the **same constituency not of each booth** will be published with the unique id's_ .<br />
 _so that the voters can check their votes with their unique id's and the number of votes each party get_. 
 ___
* _For every booth we store the votes of every voters with the autogenarated id number in the public ledger His  name and the booth number will be encrypted_ <br />
* _We will enlist the votes with that unique id in a database. This database list will contains all the id with the assigned votes of that_ **constituency (not of each  booth)**<br />
_As soon as the voting process ends we will published the database of each constituency_.
