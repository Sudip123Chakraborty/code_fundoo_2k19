# Verify Your Votes & Publish All Votes at the End
 **During** the electioin some people says that their votes were hacked and <br />
 **The** political parties also claimed that they would get more votes if the voting was done in different way.
 * Our idea is that when a voter cast his vote he will get an id at that time and
  * At the end of the election all the votes of the **same constituency not of each booth** will be published with the unique id's .<br />
 so that the voters can check their votes with their unique id's and the number of votes given to the parties 
 ___
 For every booth we store the votes of every voters with the autogenarated id number in the public ledger <br />
 and will enlist that votes with that id in a database. This database list will contains all the id with the assigned votes of that **constituency (not of each  booth)**
