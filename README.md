 ___
 * _Our idea is that when a voter cast his vote he will get an auto generated unique id at that time and_
  * _At the end of the election all the votes of the **same constituency(not of each booth)** will be published with the unique id's._<br />
 _so that the voters can check their votes with their unique id's and the number of votes each party get_. 
 
* _For every booth we store the votes of every voters with the autogenarated id number in the public ledger His  name and the booth number will be encrypted_ <br />
* _We will enlist the votes with that unique id in a database. This database list will contains all the id with the assigned votes of that_ **constituency (not of each  booth)**<br />
* _As soon as the voting process ends we will published the database of each constituency with the result of that constituency_.
___
* _When the result is out we inform all the voters via sms about the result of that constituency._
* _They can check the result online too of all constituency._
* _If they want to know the standing of the parties they have to search just constituency name ._
 * _There they can find all the votes with the unique id's and if they entered their id they can see their votes also._
