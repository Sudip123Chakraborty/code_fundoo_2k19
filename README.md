# Verify Your Votes & Publish All Votes at the End
 **During** the electioin some people says that their votes were hacked and <br />
 **The** political parties also claimed that they would get more votes if the voting was done in different way.
 * Our idea is that when a voter cast his vote he will get an unique id at that time and
 * At the end of the election all the votes of the **same constituency not of each booth** will be published with the unique id's .
